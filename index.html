<h2 style="font-size: 2.6em;">Hannah and Gil are Getting Married</h2>
<img src="hannahandgil_savethedate.png">

<!--<h2><div class="button"><a href="http://hannahandgil.info/rsvp">RSVP</a></div></h2>-->
<p>
<h2>Time and place:</h2>
	<h3>Saturday, October 16, 2021, 5:00 pm</h3>
	<h3>Joe's Garage, 443 Main St, Catskill, NY 12414</h3>

</p>

<p>
<h2>Getting there:</h2>
	
	<p><strong>By plane:</strong> Albany International Airport is small, but the closest airport option to the area. The venue is a 2.5 hour drive from major NYC airports.</p>
	
	<p><strong>By train:</strong>  Amtrak runs regular trains from Penn Station in Manhattan to Hudson. From the train station, it is a short walk into the town of Hudson, and a 10 minute taxi ride directly across the Hudson River to Catskill. 
	</p>	
	<p><strong>By car:</strong> The area is easily accessible by car.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		
<h2>Parking & Transportation:</h2>
<p>Parking is readily available by Joe’s Garage in the municipal parking lot next to Ray’s Appliances at 437 Main St. in Catskill. Street parking is also available on Main St. around Joe’s Garage.</p>

<p>Taxis and rideshare services are available in the area, but require some advance planning. We recommend contacting the following taxi services for transportation to and from Joe’s Garage:</p>

<br>Ubers / Lyfts are available, but may come with a long wait. We recommend using the Uber or Lyft app to schedule a ride in advance.</p>


<h2>Where to stay:</h2>
	We recommend looking into Airbnb / VRBO rentals and hotels and inns in Catskill, and surrounding towns, including Hudson, Leeds, Athens, Claverack, Livingston / Elizaville / Linlithgo, Germantown, Tivoli, Red Hook, Rhinebeck, Kingston / Lake Katrine, Woodstock and Saugerties.
 	<p>We suggest that our guests book lodging as soon as possible, as the Hudson Valley is a popular destination on fall weekends!
</p>

<p>
<h2>Schedule of Events:</h2>
On Friday, October 15th, please join us at the Mandel-Gentile family rental retreat in Saugerties (half-hour south of Catskill) for sandwiches, drinks and a casual welcome get together.
